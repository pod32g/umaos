# UmaOS Theme Pack Skeleton

This directory hosts source assets and mapping notes for the UmaOS visual identity.

## Included components

- KDE color scheme: `/usr/share/color-schemes/UmaSkyPink.colors`
- Wallpaper pack: `/usr/share/wallpapers/UmaOS`
- SDDM theme: `/usr/share/sddm/themes/umaos-race`
- Icon mapping overlay: `/usr/share/icons/UmaOS-Papirus`

## Replace placeholders safely

1. Replace SVG placeholders with original or correctly licensed artwork.
2. Keep image dimensions to avoid layout regressions.
3. Register each asset in `docs/ASSET-LICENSES.md` before release.
